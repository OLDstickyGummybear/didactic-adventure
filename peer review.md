- found funny bug with movement speed and lowering render distance
- world generation is realistic to minecraft
- could benefit with breaking blocks because there are blocks under
- gravity seems to be accurate but movement speed is a bit fast
- its cool 

Josh Bell:
The project is very well done, looks a lot like Minecraft, which I believe was the intention. Two things I’d change: add at least one more block type into the generation to break up the monotony, and add instructions. The lack of clear directions for how to control the project makes it very difficult to get the hang of for someone not familiar with them already. Also change the sprint key back to ctrl like a sane human as opposed to this R crap you heathen, you’re disgracing all of Minecraft
